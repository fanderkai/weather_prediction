Here is the link to the dataset that was used to build this model:<br />
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-weather-data<br />
<br />
For this project I used 15305 total rows of data, with 2 columns (date, mean_temp)<br />
The goal is to make a time series prediction model with Mean Absolute Error < 10% data scale<br />
<br />
Here is the MAE graph:<br />
